*Note: Pages may vary based on if log in is with a regular user account or an admin(security personnel) user.

- for security personnel, the log in page will direct them to the same option page with map showing available spots and spots that
  are not available, but it also displays the time remaining for said meters, that way they could easily reference to make sure 
  who has a valid meter and who does not
  
- security also has option to issue tickets to users(how that will be handled will depend on school to school)
