========================================
if(scanned code is not in system)
    -generate new meter
    -track geolocation
    
if( is in system)
    -take to payment menu
    -give option to add credit
    
========================================
- issue arises when a person moves from one spot to another
  - for example, person pays for meter 00034 and then has time there, but leaves that parking spot and moves to a different meter 00020
    does the data base display both meters at the same time, and so, does it then display the time remaining for both, or does it work 
    a way to bypass this, or know a difference and decipher the difference between the two.
========================================

THINGS TO DO FOR NEXT TIME
========================================
- rework ER diagram to include supertype subtype class for account(user/admin)
- continue working with relational structure form to ultimately make create table form to generate database
